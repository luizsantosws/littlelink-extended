# LittleLink
The DIY self-hosted LinkTree alternative. LittleLink has more than 100 branded button styles you can easily use, with more regularly added by our community in this repo and in [LittleLink Extended](https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink-extended). 

---
### 🌞 Themes and Accessibility
LittleLink offers both `light` and `dark` themes right out of the box. If the default color schemes don't match your preference, you can easily customize them by updating the values in `skeleton-light.css` or `skeleton-dark.css`. For those who prefer an automatic adjustment, setting your CSS to `skeleton-auto.css` enables the theme to adapt based on the device's system settings. To enhance visual accessibility in both `light` and `dark` modes, buttons lacking sufficient contrast with the background are outlined with an inverse stroke to ensure visibility. While LittleLink emphasizes accessibility, it's important to acknowledge that not all brands incorporated into LittleLink achieve this standard. Branded buttons that come into LittleLink always retain the original essence of the brand and some branded buttons might fall short of optimal accessibility in terms of contrast.

### 🥇 Performance

![Performance](https://cdn.cottle.cloud/littlelink/PerformanceBlock.svg)

LittleLink epitomizes simplicity and minimalism. When evaluating the [LittleLink sample page](https://littlelink.io/sample/seth) (which mirrors a typical LittleLink setup for an individual) through tools such as [Google PageSpeed Insights](https://pagespeed.web.dev/analysis/https-littlelink-io-sample-seth/17ex80ryq4?form_factor=mobile), showcases LittleLink's excellence with 100/100 in Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO. My initial vision for LittleLink was to craft it from the fundamentals. I chose [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) as the foundation, enabling me to create something minimal and quick, removing the unnecessary bloat you would get from using a large framework for a page that requires nothing more than simplicity.

### ☁️ Deploy

![Publish](https://cdn.cottle.cloud/littlelink/Deployment.svg)

No need for gulp, npm, or anything else to make LittleLink work—it uses the bare essentials. You can automatically fork and deploy LittleLink with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), or [Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify) using the button below. LittleLink is also easy to host through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or on your home lab server, CDN, or other frontend hosting services. To edit, all you need is a little basic HTML knowledge to add a link to the exisiting buttons or you can create your own. See our [adding custom buttons to your own fork wiki](https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink/wiki/Adding-custom-buttons-to-your-own-fork). It's simple, promise. 🤞

# 🔗 LittleLink Extended

![Logo](https://cdn.cottle.cloud/GitHub/LittleLink/littlelink.gif)

**LittleLink Extended** is an add-on repository for [LittleLink](https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink). It welcomes more niche or region-specific services that aren’t quite popular enough for the core LittleLink repo. By importing this extension, you can expand your LittleLink setup with additional brands and icons. You can either import everything or selectively copy only the pieces you need.

---

## 📂 Getting Started

To use **LittleLink Extended**, you’ll need a copy of the original [LittleLink project](https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink). Fork or download that repository first.

Then:

1. **Clone or download** this **LittleLink Extended** repo.
2. **Copy the necessary files** (CSS and icons) into your LittleLink project.
3. **Reference the new CSS** in your `index.html`.

### 1. Import the Extended CSS

In this repo’s `css` folder, you’ll find **`brands-extended.css`**. Copy that file into the `css` folder of your LittleLink project. Your folder structure should look something like this afterward:

```
littlelink
│
├── css
│   ├── reset.css
│   ├── style.css
│   ├── brands.css
│   └── brands-extended.css ← (new)
│
└── images
    └── icons
```

### 2. Import the Extended Icons

In this repo’s `images` folder, you’ll find a folder named **`icons-extended`**. Copy that entire folder into the `images` folder of your LittleLink project. Your structure might then look like:

```
littlelink
│
├── css
│   ├── ...
├── images
│   ├── avatar.png
│   ├── icons
│   └── icons-extended ← (new)
└── ...
```

When you need to reference an extended icon, you’ll do so via `images/icons-extended/...`.

### 3. Edit `index.html` to Include the Extended CSS

Open your LittleLink project’s `index.html`. In the `<head>` section, find the line that references `brands.css`:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/brands.css">
```

Beneath it, add a line for the extended CSS:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/brands-extended.css">
```

It should look something like:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/reset.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/brands.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/brands-extended.css">
```

That’s all you need to pull in the extended brand styles.

---

## 👍 That’s It!

At this point, you’ve successfully imported **LittleLink Extended**. To see how to use the newly added buttons, simply reference them in your `index.html` or `preview.html` by using their associated classes (e.g., `button-anilist`, `button-bereal`, etc.).

For more information on the original LittleLink project, check out the [LittleLink repo](https://github.com/sethcottle/littlelink).

# Extended Modules

## Sensitive Content Warning

In addition to extended brands, this repository includes an **optional module** for adding **“Sensitive Content”** warnings. This module lets you display a slide-down panel warning users about potentially sensitive or age-restricted content. Each panel can include a **“Continue”** button that opens a custom link, set entirely in your HTML.

<img 
  src="https://cdn.cottle.cloud/GitHub/LittleLink/sensitive-content-warning.gif"
  alt="Sensitive Content Warning"
  width="50%"
/>

### How It Works

1. **Copy the CSS**  
   Download `sensitive-content.css` from this repo (in the `css` folder) and place it in your LittleLink project’s `css` folder. You can adjust the button color that is declared in `sensitive-content.css` or use a button color style from `brands.css` or `brands-extended.css` to adjust the button to any styling of your choice.

2. **Copy the JS**  
   Download `js` folder which contains `sensitive-content.js` from this repo and place it in your LittleLink project. By default LittleLink doesn't use any JS.

3. **Reference Them**  
   In your `index.html` (or `preview.html` in LittleLink Extended), add the CSS after your main styles:
   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/brands-extended.css">
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/sensitive-content.css"> <!-- new -->
   ```
   Then load the JS near the bottom of `<body>`:
   ```html
   <script src="js/sensitive-content.js"></script>
   ```

4. **Add the HTML Snippet**  
   Wherever you want a “Sensitive Content” button, insert:
   ```html
   <div class="slide-container" data-continue-url="https://example.com">
     <a class="button button-default sensitive-trigger" href="javascript:void(0)">
       <img class="icon" aria-hidden="true" src="images/icons/generic-warning.svg" alt="Warning Icon">
       Sensitive Content
     </a>
     <div class="sensitive-panel">
       <div class="sensitive-panel__content">
         <p>This link may contain content that is not appropriate for all audiences.</p>
         <button class="button button-default sensitive-continue">Continue</button>
       </div>
     </div>
   </div>
   ```
   - **`data-continue-url="..."`** sets the external link for the “Continue” button.  
   - **`.sensitive-trigger`** toggles the panel open/close.  
   - **`.sensitive-panel`** is the collapsible container.  
   - **`.sensitive-continue`** triggers navigation to the `data-continue-url`.

### Multiple Sensitive Content Panels

You can add **multiple** sensitive content panels by repeating the snippet above with different `data-continue-url` values. The JS automatically handles each one independently, so each panel can open a different link.
